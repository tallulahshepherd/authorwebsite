      <p><i>Cursed with prophecy, and haunted by her past, facing herself may mean losing the only thing she’s ever tried to save.</i><br><br>

        Fenn Kerry returns home to Alderland, after fleeing seven years ago. Fenn is haunted by the mythical figure of the Fox-Fire witch, fearing with each step that she might lose control of her unpredictable magic, and end up with the same tragic fate. When she returns home, she finds ghosts of another kind, in the form of the disgraced Prince Owin Maddox raising their daughter without her. <br><br>
But when their daughter is threatened, only Fox-Fire will be able to save her. For better or worse, Fenn must let Fox-Fire in, and save what she cares about the most. In doing so, she’ll change the face of Alderland forever. <br><br>
She will be hunted, exiled, and betrayed before she has to make an impossible choice. Will she save Alderland and rid herself of the Fox-Fire witch for good? Or will she ally herself with her darker half, for the sake of those she cares for most?
